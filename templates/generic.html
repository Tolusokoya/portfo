						<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
						<p>Hello, my name is Tolu Sokoya, and I'm currently a junior at Texas A&M. I am a very mature and a hard working individual due to the adversity I have faced in my life. I would be a great candidate for your organization and would only put my best foot forward. I am a knowledgeable student who has the ability to pick things up quickly and contribute to any team. I have a strong track record of task completion through teamwork, communication, and leadership in successful projects. Lastly, I have a strong academic record along with evidence of commitment and integrity.</p>

								<h3>College Years</h3>
								<p>I am a junior Geographic Information Science and Technology major with a minor in Cybersecurity. By the grace of God, I was given the opportunity to attend Texas A&M University with some scholarship money, where I started in August of 2021. Iâ€™ve joined numerous clubs and organizations since enrolled at this university, including Excel Student Mentor, Texas A&M DMS Student Ambassadors, and recently joined the Pi Omicron Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated. I am currently on track to graduate in May 2025, where I hope to pursue a career in the technology industry.</p>

								<h3>High School Years</h3>
								<p>I graduated from Lone Star High School in Frisco, Texas, in May of 2021, where I finished borderline top 10 percent with a 3.8 unweighted and 4.8 weighted GPA. I was very active in high school and was a member of the National Honor Society, Yearbook, Varsity Track for 2 years, and was a Varsity Football Player all 4 years of high school. I even had the honor of being an all district wide receiver for my junior and senior seasons. High school gave me a blueprint on how to successfully communicate and work with all kinds of people, no matter what race, gender, or background.  </p>
